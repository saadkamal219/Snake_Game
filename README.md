# Snake_Game

Basic Snake Game that is made with basic python programming concept and python library. This code throws a new window and can be used as an application but the user inputs such as taking the color of snake head and snake body will appear in the terminal. The system of multiple terminal was proposed but python "Turtle" library barely support multiple window for same program.

This game is so user friendly and easy to play. When testing the game, I though adding some sound effects so that it can give a feel of Nokia Button phone snake game version.

Libraries used:

1. Turtle
2. Time
3. Random
4. OS
5. Pygame

# How to add the game as an application

For Linux user [ Ubuntu 20.04 ]:

1. Go to main menu.
2. To be continued.....
